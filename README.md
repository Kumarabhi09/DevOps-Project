    AWS CodePipeline: This DevOps tool automates continuously deployed code for fast and accurate updates.
    AWS EC2 and S3 bucket: In AWS, we can create a virtual machine that falls within our requirements, i.e., if we need 2 core CPUs, we can create it without extra charges. Apart from this, the S3 bucket service allows the user to store the data and host the website.
    AWS Codestar: Codestar is a useful tool for doing DevOps on AWS. It provides an intuitive user interface that makes it easy to develop, build, and deploy applications on AWS. Set up a complete continuous delivery toolchain in minutes.
